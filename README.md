For the list below, write out each step of the sorting process for both bubble and merge sorts.

(7, 2, 23, 6, 30, 15, 30, 22)

## Bubble sort:

### Pass 1

(**7**, **2**, 23, 6, 30, 15, 30, 22) -> (**2**, **7**, 23, 6, 30, 15, 30, 22) swap, since 7 > 2

(2, **7**, **23**, 6, 30, 15, 30, 22) -> (2, **7**, **23**, 6, 30, 15, 30, 22) no swap, since 7 < 23

(2, 6, 7, 15, 22, **23**, **30**, 30) -> (2, 6, 7, 15, 22, **23**, **30**, 30) no swap, since  23 < 30

(2, 6, 7, 15, 22, 23, **30**, **30**) -> (2, 6, 7, 15, 22, 23, **30**, **30**) no swap, since  30 = 30


### Pass 4

(2, 6, 7, 15, 22, **23**, **30**, 30) -> (2, 6, 7, 15, 22, **23**, **30**, 30) no swap, since  23 < 30

(2, 6, 7, 15, 22, 23, **30**, **30**) -> (2, 6, 7, 15, 22, 23, **30**, **30**) no swap, since  30 = 30


After the fourth pass, the list is in order.

## Merge sort:

           (7, 2, 23, 6, 30, 15, 30, 22)

                 /            \

          (7, 2, 23, 6)  (30, 15, 30, 22)
     
            /    \            /    \

        (7, 2) (23, 6)   (30, 15) (30, 22)
   
         /\       /\        /\       /\

      (7) (2)  (23) (6)  (30) (15) (30) (22)

         \/      \/         \/       \/
        
       (2, 7) (6, 23)   (15, 30) (22, 30)
        
             \/                 \/

         (2, 6, 7, 23)    (15, 22, 30, 30)
